# Todo Component Design

1. Create list of components as follows:
    - Todo Component - Renders a todo on page (description with status)
        - on click of todo update the state of the todo
        - should have a prop desc for description and status for the current state(complete or pending)
        - should have a prop deleteTodo which will be a function that deletes todo from the todoList
    - TodoList Component - Renders the TodoList containing list of Todo components on page
        - should have a state containing list of todos
        - should have a method deleteTodo to be passed to each todo component which will be called on click of a delete button of a respective Todo
        - it should take todos as a prop which will contain the array of todos
2. on click of todo update the value of the current status i.e if complete set it to pending and vice versa
3. Add a button in a todo containing Delete text
    - On click should delete the todo from the todo list
    - this button should be part of Todo component
    - on click it should update the todolist in the state of TodoList component
    - delete should only delete the todo whose delete button is clicked
